# LocalDeals1


Online Marketplace for neighbors to buy and sell items.

My initial intention for this project was to attempt replicating an e-commerce store such as eBay and its features to the best of my ability .This was Built using Django for the backend, BootStrap for the Frontend, AWS RDS, AWS S3, and Heroku for deployment. Includes features like messaging, creating, deleting, and editing products, user dashboard, and search filter capabilities.
